Yo, This Is Third Part!

I already explain $getVar and $getUserVar On Part 1

Here all codes:

Local:
$setUserVar[Money;$sub[$getUserVar[Money];ptices]] - Remove Their Money How Much The Prices Of That Items
$setUserVar[item1;$sum[$getUserVar[item1];1]] - Get The Items

Global:
$setVar[Money;$sub[$getVar[Money;$authorID];prices];$authorID]
$setVar[item1;$sum[$getVar[item1;$authorID];1];$authorID]

$onlyIf[$getVar[Money;$authorID]>Prices;Bruh you don't have enough Money!] - When They Not Have Enough Money To Buy Items
